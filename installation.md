## Installation

To run SALI, you need **three different components** that have to be installed seperately on your machine:

### Electron Application

The electron application handles backend, database and the suggestion algorithm. To install it, please download and execute the respective electron app for your operation system from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZRZPlPFVNyE5DtQS1NxjQfOb4xZLk7vl?usp=sharing).

The app has to be running when you are coding. If you do not want to think about it, add it to your system's autostart:
- Add app to [Windows Autostart](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-app-to-run-automatically-at-startup-in-windows-10-150da165-dcd9-7230-517b-cf3c295d89dd)
- Add app to [Mac Autostart](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/03/24/apps-launch-system-startup-mac/)

### VS-Code Extension

The VS Code extension is the actual extension displayed in your IDE. Please add it from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=royru.sali) to your VS Code.

### Browser Extension

To be able to make suggestions based on your browser history, you must also install a browser extension to either _Firefox_ or _Chrome_.

**For Chrome users:**

1. Download the respective package from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MGik2RltRwymnOimNfj-zq5nrHOsXUgO?usp=sharing).
2. Unzip the folder and save it in your preferred place on your machine. The folder must stay in your chosen location during the whole study.
3. Type/copy `chrome:extensions` into your Chrome Address Bar and open it.
4. Toggle "Developer Mode" on the upper right side.
5. Then click on "Load unpacked" and choose the unzipped folder.
