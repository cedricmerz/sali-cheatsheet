## Purpose and Usage of SALI

Have you ever coded something with the help of webpages such as documentations or forums like Stackoverflow, but some time later you cannot understand anymore what you actually created, and you cannot find the corresponding website anymore? Or you cannot understand what your team mates developed, because they have not documented from where they got their informations?

SALI to the rescue! SALI stands for a "**S**emi-**A**utomated, **l**ightweight, **i**nline approach" and this name is program: Our tool helps you to find, remember, and store relevant web pages during coding in a semi-automated approach, and to share them with your team. The app intelligently analyses your activity in your browser and suggests you to add relevant weblinks to the corresponding code you are writing. This helps you to document your activity and save links for later when you or your team need them again - all without cluttering your code through comments. <br/><br/>
